# Pico 2 Research
There are two main aspects of this research project.

1. The first goal is to find differences in power consumption and efficiency between the ARM and RISC-V CPU cores on the Pico 2.
2. The second goal is to find a way to switch between the ARM and RISC-V cores using an RTOS, specifically FreeRTOS for this project.

The goal result is for the Pico 2 to be able to switch architectures based on how demanding the current task is, which will be used in object detection and automatic facial recognition software.
